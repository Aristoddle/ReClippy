# ReClippy

Do you remember Clippy? I actually saw him last week in a dusty bunker with a PS2 mouse but a nearly modern monitor ;)  I had some fun and brought him back to the desktop. Originally, he was supposed to just put Windows tips on the desktop (which he still does), but then I linked him to the BloatynosyAI (now CoTweaker) database, and now he can customize Windows 10 and Windows 11, observe your system, and even provide recommendations for removing apps. 

**How does it work?**
Double-click "clippit.exe" to start, and a chat window should automatically open. If you close it, you can reopen it with a click on Clippy. Right-click on Clippy to close him again.
