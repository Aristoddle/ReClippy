# ReClippy

Do you remember Clippy? I actually saw him last week in a dusty bunker with a PS2 mouse but a nearly modern monitor ;)  I had some fun and brought him back to the desktop. Originally, he was supposed to just put Windows tips on the desktop (which he still does), but then I linked him to the BloatynosyAI (now CoTweaker) database (so currently without GPT), and now he can customize Windows 10 and Windows 11, observe your system, and even provide recommendations for removing apps. 

**How does it work?**
Double-click "clippit.exe" to start, and a chat window should automatically open. If you close it, you can reopen it with a click on Clippy. Right-click on Clippy to close him again.
Individual actions may fail (watch out for access errors), and clippit.exe must be run as an administrator. 

During your work, Reclippy will pep you up with snappy remarks and tips, akin to the original Clippy, and might possibly annoy you. (Settings to control this will be added later.) You can search in the chatbot with Ctrl + F and also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.
